## Project Overview
Inventory Management System allows the (user / admin) control the Inventory of a buisness or warehouse etc. Our goal is to use oop and create a class with the required methods to control the inventory and get data aswell as a seperate class that will handle the registration for the user to login into the inventory management system.
